### Welcome to my Github! 

Hi! My name is Thomas Clark, I am a '22 at Dartmouth College, I use he/him/his pronouns, and this is my github repo. Its small, but always growing. Feel free to reach out about open source collaborations or any questions about code you want to borrow! 

* 📚 I’m currently studying computer engineering at Dartmouth. Working on a 4-year BA+BE
* 🌱 I’m currently working on learning C++ and taking coursese in the more abstract parts of computer science 
* 🤔 I’m looking for help getting involved in open-source. If you have a cool project, feel free to reach out! 
* I love meeting new people and learning more about the developer community
* 💬 Ask me about C, backend programming, discrete math, teaching engineering, or bringing summer camp energy to every team project
* 📫 email me @ [wmtclark@gmail.com](mailto:wmtclark@gmail.com)
